# Todo App

This a generic and basic Todo App developed using flutter and concepts of Clean Architecture by Uncle Bob (Robert Martin).
In this project I explore and learn to create a full CRUD (minus D) implementing the interpretation of clean architecture provided by Reso Coder.

This project is meant to be a flutter learning experience for me so errors are surely present.

If someone comes across this project, you can use it however you want and feal free to tell me where I went wrong! XD.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have flutter installed and running.

1- Clone the repository
2- run ´´´pub get´´´ to get all dependencies installed

The project has a battery of unit tests you can run to see if everything is working!
